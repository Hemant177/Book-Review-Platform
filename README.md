# Book-Review-Platform
Book Review Platform is a full-stack web app where users can sign up, log in, browse books, add reviews, and manage a watchlist. Built with React.js (frontend) and Flask (backend), it uses JWT authentication, REST APIs, and a SQL database. Interactive popups notify users of actions like “Login Successfully” or “Book Added Successfully.”
